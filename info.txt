WSPR_Helper

The WSPR_Helper should allow to synchroize up to 3 JTDX instances. All three transceiver shall transmit in the same time slots.
This version is a very first version, only to verify the handling of all JTDX instances.
A scheduler will be implemented later on.
At this time JTDX -159 and 160 are supported.
